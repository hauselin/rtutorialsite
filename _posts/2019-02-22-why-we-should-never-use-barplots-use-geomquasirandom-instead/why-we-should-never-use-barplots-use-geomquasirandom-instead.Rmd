## Dynamite or bar plots must die?

A [recent open letter to journal editors](https://simplystatistics.org/2019/02/21/dynamite-plots-must-die/) said that "dynamite plots must die".

> Statisticians have been pointing out the problem with dynamite plots^[[simply statistics site](https://simplystatistics.org/2019/02/21/dynamite-plots-must-die/)], also known as bar and line graphs, for years. Karl Broman lists them as one of the top ten worst graphs^[Check out the top 10 worst graphs [here](https://www.biostat.wisc.edu/~kbroman/topten_worstgraphs)]. The problem has even been documented in the peer reviewed literature.

> One of my professional pet peeves is dynamite plots. Sometimes they are incorrectly referred to as bar plots. Dynamite plots do not have a formal name because they are not a part of conventional statistical graphics that should be used in reporting scientific results. But they are everywhere! ~ Tatsuki Koyama (Vanderbilt Biostatistics)

> Graphics reveal data, communicate complex ideas and dependencies with clarity, precision and efficiency. ~ Edward Tufte

Many others have also suggested we need to plot better [@drummond2011;@Weissgerber2015]. Here, I'm simulating datasets to compare barplots (dynamite plots), boxplots, violin plots, and another kind of plot I prefer ([ggbeeswarm](https://github.com/eclarke/ggbeeswarm)). 

```{r loading packages, results="hide", message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# load packages
library(data.table); library(tidyverse); library(gganimate); 
library(ggbeeswarm); library(rmarkdown); library(knitr)
theme_set(theme_bw())  # set overall ggplot theme
```

## Randomly generate 10 datasets with same mean and sd

Within each dataset, we have data from two groups, with 50 data points (e.g., subjects) per group. One group has mean 100 (sd = 15) and the other has mean 105 (sd = 45). 

```{r generate data with rnorm2, layout="l-body-outset"}
# extend R's rnorm() function 
# rnormFixed generates random data from a normal distribution 
# but ensures mean and sd values are exactly what we wanted
rnormFixed <- function(n, mean, sd) {
    mean + sd * scale(rnorm(n))
}

set.seed(1) # to ensure results/figures can be replicated
n <- 50 # datapoints per group
datasets <- 10

# generate datasets
dt1 <- lapply(1:datasets, # loop iterator 
              function(x) {data.table(
                scores = c(rnormFixed(n = n, mean = 100, sd = 15), # mean of group 1
                           rnormFixed(n = n, mean = 105, sd = 45)), # mean of group 2
                group = rep(x = c("group 1", "group 2"), each = n), # condition label
                dataset = x)})
dt1 <- bind_rows(dt1) # bind list containing separate datasets into a dataframe 
dt1
```

Compute mean and standard deviation for each dataset and group.

```{r}
dt1[, .(scores = mean(scores), scores_stdev = sd(scores)), by = .(dataset, group)]
```

## R code to generate four figures below

Compare barplot, boxplot, violin plot, and plot with `geom_quasirandom()` from `ggbeeswarm` package.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
# barplot
plot_bar <- ggplot(dt1, aes(group, scores)) + 
    stat_summary(fun.y = mean, geom = 'bar', size = 6) +
    stat_summary(fun.data = mean_cl_normal, geom = 'errorbar', width = 0, size = 1.1) +
    transition_states(dataset) +
    labs(x = 'Sample {closest_state}')
plot_bar
# anim_save("./attachments/plot_bar.gif", plot_bar)
```

```{r eval=FALSE}
plot_boxplot <- ggplot(dt1, aes(group, scores)) + 
    geom_boxplot() +
    stat_summary(fun.y = mean, geom = 'point', shape = 95, size = 6) +
    stat_summary(fun.data = mean_cl_normal, geom = 'errorbar', width = 0) +
    transition_states(dataset) +
    labs(x = 'Sample {closest_state}')
plot_boxplot
# anim_save("./attachments/plot_boxplot.gif", plot_boxplot)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE}
plot_violin <- ggplot(dt1, aes(group, scores)) +
    geom_violin() +
    stat_summary(fun.y = mean, geom = 'point', shape = 95, size = 6) +
    stat_summary(fun.data = mean_cl_normal, geom = 'errorbar', width = 0, size = 1.1) +
    scale_colour_viridis_d(begin = 0, end = 0.5) +
    transition_states(dataset) +
    labs(x = 'Sample {closest_state}')
plot_violin
# anim_save("./attachments/plot_violin.gif", plot_violin)
```

```{r, eval=FALSE, preview=TRUE}
plot_dotdist <- ggplot(dt1, aes(group, scores)) +
    geom_quasirandom(alpha = 0.2) +
    stat_summary(fun.y = mean, geom = 'point', shape = 95, size = 6) +
    stat_summary(fun.data = mean_cl_normal, geom = 'errorbar', width = 0, size = 1.1) +
    scale_colour_viridis_d(begin = 0, end = 0.5) +
    transition_states(dataset) +
    labs(x = 'Sample {closest_state}')
plot_dotdist
# anim_save("./attachments/plot_dotdist.gif", plot_dotdist)
```

## Comparing bar plots, boxplots, violin plots, and `geom_quasirandom()` plots

Note what happens in the four figures below.

* Barplots hide data. Means and standard deviation don't change across the 10 datasets.
* Boxplot are slightly more informative and shows the outliers.
* Violin plots are also informative. They show the distributions.
* `geom_quasirandom` from [ggbeeswarm](https://github.com/eclarke/ggbeeswarm) package plots the distribution and dots. Such plots are most informative.

```{r, out.width="50%", echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics(c("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hauselin/rtutorialsite/master/attachments/plot_bar.gif", 
                          "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hauselin/rtutorialsite/master/attachments/plot_boxplot.gif", 
                          "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hauselin/rtutorialsite/master/attachments/plot_violin.gif", 
                          "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hauselin/rtutorialsite/master/attachments/plot_dotdist.gif"))
```
