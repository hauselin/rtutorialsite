### Consider being a patron and supporting my work?

[Donate and become a patron](https://donorbox.org/support-my-teaching): If you find value in what I do and have learned something from my site, please consider becoming a patron. It takes me many hours to research, learn, and put together tutorials. Your support really matters.

### Machine learning

[Mathematics for machine learning specialization (3 courses)](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/mathematics-machine-learning)

### Computer science

[MITx 6.00.1x Introduction to Computer Science and Programming Using Python](https://www.edx.org/course/6-00-1x-introduction-to-computer-science-and-programming-using-python-3)

* This course is one of the most popular online computer science course, with [more than a million enrollments](https://news.mit.edu/2018/first-mitx-mooc-reaches-enrollment-milestone-0830).
